# CCNP Labs

🗄️I'm going to start putting some CCNP/CCNA labs together here. The layout of each of these will be a seperate file for each, including a readme.md with the purpose of the lab (and video link after it is filmed), a diagram, and two folders containing the intial configs and the final configs.

💻You can find the walkthrough videos for these labs [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw78nfbi6DWi6inkEr6XwdPniGl9jEGfm)
